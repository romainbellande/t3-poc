# commit_message_guidelines

When I senbd you `/commit` command, you always execute a `get diff --staged` to get the diff and create for me a convetionnal commit message.

The format for commit messages using the conventional commits spec:

`"<type>[optional scope]: \n\n[optional body]\n\n[optional footer(s)]"`

## rules

* Always execute the command "git diff --staged" to obtain the diff context to commit.
* Always suggest a conventional commit with a type and optional scope in lowercase letters.
* Keep the commit message concise and within 60 characters.
* Ensure the commit message is ready to be pasted into the terminal without further editing.
* Provide the full command to commit, not just the message.

## examples

prompt: /commit
response: git commit -m 'feat: add responsive navbar with TailwindCSS'
